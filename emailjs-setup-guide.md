## Step 4: Get Your Credentials

After creating templates, gather these from your EmailJS dashboard:

1. **Public Key**: Dashboard â†’ Account â†’ General â†’ Public Key
2. **Service ID**: Email Services â†’ Your Service â†’ Service ID  
3. **Template IDs**: Templates â†’ Each template â†’ Template ID

## Step 5: Update Platform Configuration

Replace the placeholder values in the email configuration files:

### Email Test Page
- Update `YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
- Update `YOUR_SERVICE_ID` 
- Update `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID`

### Community Page Email Features
- Connection requests
- Obstacle support emails
- Follow-up reminders

## Step 6: Test Email Functionality

1. Visit: https://mogulmomma.com/email-test
2. Enter your email address
3. Send a test email
4. Check your inbox (and spam folder)
5. Test connection requests in community
6. Test obstacle breakthrough emails

## EmailJS Free Plan Limits

- **200 emails/month** (free)
- **Upgrade to $20/month** for 2,000 emails
- **$50/month** for 10,000 emails

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Emails going to spam**: Add no-reply@emailjs.com to contacts
2. **Gmail not working**: Enable 2FA and use App Password
3. **Template not found**: Check Template ID is correct
4. **Service error**: Verify Service ID and email connection

### Testing Tips:
- Always test with your own email first
- Check EmailJS dashboard for delivery logs
- Monitor the browser console for errors
- Verify all template variables are being passed correctly

## Production Recommendations

1. **Use a business email** (not Gmail) for sending
2. **Set up proper SPF/DKIM** records for deliverability
3. **Monitor email metrics** in EmailJS dashboard
4. **Consider upgrading** to paid plan for higher limits
5. **Add unsubscribe handling** for compliance
